# Calculator

# This project is a simple JavaScript calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as part of TOP foundation curriculum.

# Skills Demonstrated
- **All JavaScript fundamentals:** functions, conditionals, and operators.
- **Debugging:** preventing bugs impact the functionality.
- **Problem-solving:** creating a reusable function that handles multiple operations.
- **Code organization:** writing simple and understandable logic for clarity and readability.

# Reflection
This project helped me to firm my understanding of basic JavaScript concepts and how to structure small, functional programs. It showed the importance of handling edge cases (like division by zero) and writing clear, readable code. Moving forward, I plan to expand this project to include interactive user input and a graphical interface to practice DOM manipulation and event handling.
